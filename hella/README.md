# Hella
Hella is inspired by an episode of South Park in which Cartman replaces adds "hella-" to the start of all adjectives. Wondering if I could code that, I used a NLP library to identify adjectives and add "hella-" to the start. 
This program is using the `prose` library, which you can get with the command `go get github.com/jdkato/prose`.
This program was written on a Mac, so the only tested executable is the Mac one. If the ones that were cross-compiled don't work, I would greatly appreciate it if someone could compile natively. 
Thanks!
